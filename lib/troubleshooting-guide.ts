        question: "Why can't I list any buckets with --no-sign-request?",
        answer:
          "The command 'aws s3 ls --no-sign-request' lists buckets you have permission to access anonymously. If no results appear, you may not have unauthenticated access to any public buckets. Try searching for the specific bucket name or use authenticated credentials.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between ListBucket and GetObject permissions?",
        answer:
          "ListBucket permission allows listing objects in a bucket. GetObject permission allows reading object contents. A bucket can be publicly readable (GetObject) but not listable (no ListBucket), meaning you need to know the exact file path.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I download multiple files from S3?",
        answer:
          'Use "aws s3 sync" to recursively download all objects: aws s3 sync s3://bucket-name . --no-sign-request. Files will be saved to your local directory with the same structure as S3.',
      },
      {
        question: "What does 'AllUsers' mean in bucket ACLs?",
        answer:
          "'AllUsers' refers to unauthenticated internet users. If a bucket ACL grants permissions to AllUsers, it means anyone without AWS credentials can perform those actions. This is extremely dangerous for sensitive data.",
      },
    ],
    commonIssues: [
      {
        error: "NoSuchBucket",
        cause: "The bucket name doesn't exist or is in a different AWS region than specified",
        solution:
          "Verify the exact bucket name spelling. Try: aws s3 ls | grep bucket-name. If still not found, the bucket may be in another region or deleted.",
        preventionTip:
          "Always verify bucket names with 's3 ls' first. Use regional endpoints if accessing buckets in specific regions.",
      },

        error: "AccessDenied or 403 Forbidden",
        cause: "The bucket exists but you don't have permission to access it (not publicly accessible)",
        solution:
          "The bucket has restricted permissions. If testing security, use authenticated AWS credentials with appropriate IAM policies.",

    title: "IAM Privilege Escalation - Troubleshooting Guide",
    faq: [
      {
        question: "What's the difference between attached policies and inline policies?",
        answer:
          "Attached policies are managed policies (created separately and can be reused). Inline policies are embedded directly in users/roles. To escalate, you need CreatePolicyVersion or PutUserPolicy permissions.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know what permissions a user has?",
        answer:
          "Use: aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name USERNAME (for managed policies) and aws iam list-user-policies --user-name USERNAME (for inline policies). Then get details with get-user-policy or get-policy-version.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does 'AssumeRole' permission do?",
        answer:
          "AssumeRole allows a user to switch to a different IAM role, potentially gaining its higher permissions. Check trust relationships with get-role and look for broad Principal conditions.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I escalate privileges without being an IAM admin?",
        answer:
          "Yes, if you have specific permissions like: CreateAccessKey, CreateLoginProfile, AttachUserPolicy, PutUserPolicy, or AssumeRole to privileged roles. These are often overlooked in security groups.",
      },
    ],

      {

        cause: "Your current user/role lacks IAM:* permissions or specific IAM action permissions",
        solution:
          "You may not have permission to enumerate or modify IAM. Check your current privileges with: aws iam get-user and aws iam list-attached-user-policies.",
        preventionTip:
          "Follow principle of least privilege. Only grant IAM permissions to users who absolutely need them.",
      },
      {
        error: "is not authorized to perform: iam:GetUser because no permissions boundary allows the iam:GetUser action",
        cause: "Your sandbox AWS account has a permissions boundary that restricts IAM operations. This is a limitation of the AWS sandbox environment.",
        solution:
          "This is a known limitation of AWS sandbox accounts with permissions boundaries. Possible solutions:\n" +
          "1. Try using different AWS services that don't require IAM access (S3, EC2, Lambda)\n" +
          "2. For IAM labs, the sandbox may need additional permissions configured\n" +
          "3. Contact your administrator to update the CyberRangeLabManagerRole permissions boundary",
        preventionTip:
          "Sandbox environments often have restricted IAM access. Plan your lab exercises accordingly or use non-IAM services.",

      },
      {
        error: "MalformedPolicyDocument when creating policy",
        cause: "JSON policy syntax is invalid",
        solution:
          "Validate JSON syntax. Use jq or JSON validators. Most common: missing commas, incorrect statement structure, or invalid ARN format.",
        preventionTip:
          "Use AWS Policy Generator or validated templates instead of writing policies from scratch.",

    title: "EC2 Security - Troubleshooting Guide",
    faq: [
      {
        question: "How do I find EC2 instances with open SSH access?",
        answer:
          'Use: aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=ip-permission.from-port,Values=22 Name=ip-permission.cidr,Values=0.0.0.0/0. This finds security groups allowing SSH from anywhere.',
      },
      {
        question: "What is IMDS and why is it dangerous?",
        answer:
          "IMDS (Instance Metadata Service) allows EC2 instances to query their metadata including temporary credentials. If accessible from outside the instance, attackers can steal credentials. Always use IMDSv2 with tokens.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I access IMDS from my laptop?",
        answer:
          "No, IMDS is only accessible from within the EC2 instance (169.254.169.254). However, if you gain shell access to an instance via SSH or RCE, you can then query IMDS.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I protect against IMDS exploitation?",
        answer:
          "Use IMDSv2 which requires tokens and HTTP PUT requests (harder to exploit). Disable IMDS if not needed. Restrict security groups. Use IAM instance profiles with minimal permissions.",
      },
